# CVCV
Tool designed to analyze resumes and job descriptions and determine the match percentage between a candidate and a job. 
The primary goal is to check whether a candidate is qualified for a role based on their education, experience, and other information captured in their resume. 
It uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques for pattern matching.
